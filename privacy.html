This Chrome extension (“the Extension”) is designed to enhance your browsing experience on Twitter/X by allowing you to add personal notes to tweet authors.

1. Information We Collect

We do not collect, store, transmit, or process any personal data from users.
	•	No account information
	•	No browsing history
	•	No cookies
	•	No analytics
	•	No data is sent to external servers

All notes you create are stored locally in your own browser’s chrome.storage, controlled entirely by the Chrome browser and never transmitted elsewhere.

2. How We Use Data

Since we do not collect any data, there is no data usage.

3. Third-Party Sharing

We do not share any data with any third parties.

4. Permissions

The extension requests only the minimal permissions required to function:
	•	"storage": used exclusively to save your notes locally

The extension cannot access any other sites or data.
